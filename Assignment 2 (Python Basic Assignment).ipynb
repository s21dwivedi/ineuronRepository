    "2. What are the three different types of Boolean operators?\n",
    "Ans>Three different types of boolean operators are as follows :\n",
    "    \n",
    "    The AND operator (&& or “and”)\n",
    "\tAND boolean operator is similar to the bitwise AND operator where the operator analyzes \n",
    "        the expressions written on both sides and returns the output.\n",
    "\tExample: True and True = True, \n",
    "                 True and False = False\n",
    "\t\t False and True = False\n",
    "\t\t False and False = False\n",
    "    The OR operator (|| or “or”)\n",
    "\tOR operator is similar to the OR bitwise operator. In the bitwise OR, we were focussing on either of the bit being 1. Here, \n",
    "        we take into account if either of the expression is true or not. If at least one expression is true, \n",
    "        consequently, the result is true.\n",

    "        \tTrue or False = True\n",
    "\t\tFalse or True = True\n",
    "\t\tFalse or False = False\n",
    "    The NOT operator (not)\n",
    "\tNOT operator reverses the result of the boolean expression that follows the operator. It is important to note that the NOT \n",
    "\toperator will only reverse the final result of the expression that immediately follows.\n",
    "    \t\tnot(True) = False\n",

    "Ans>Comaprison operators are as follows \n",
    "\t>\tGreater than - True if left operand is greater than the right(x > y)\n",
